The following basic measures have been implemented for `Graph` and `DiGraph`
types:

## Vertices and Edges

{{
    vertices
    edges
    is_directed
    nv
    ne
    has_edge
    has_vertex
    in_edges
    out_edges
    src
    dst
    reverse
}}

## Neighbors and Degree

{{degree, indegree, outdegree, Δ, δ, Δout, δout, δin, Δin, degree_histogram, density, neighbors, in_neighbors, all_neighbors, common_neighbors}}
