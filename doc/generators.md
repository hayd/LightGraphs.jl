## Random Graphs
*LightGraphs.jl* implements three common random graph generators:

{{erdos_renyi, watts_strogatz, random_regular_graph, random_regular_digraph}}

## Static Graphs
*LightGraphs.jl* also implements a collection of classic graph generators:

{{CompleteGraph, CompleteDiGraph, StarGraph, StarDiGraph,PathGraph, PathDiGraph, WheelGraph, WheelDiGraph}}

The following graphs are undirected only:

{{DiamondGraph, BullGraph, ChvatalGraph, CubicalGraph, DesarguesGraph, DodecahedralGraph, FruchtGraph, HeawoodGraph, HouseGraph, HouseXGraph, IcosahedralGraph, KrackhardtKiteGraph, MoebiusKantorGraph, OctahedralGraph, PappusGraph, PetersenGraph, SedgewickMazeGraph, TetrahedralGraph, TruncatedCubeGraph, TruncatedTetrahedronGraph, TutteGraph}}
