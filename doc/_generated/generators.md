## Random Graphs
*LightGraphs.jl* implements three common random graph generators:

### erdos_renyi
```
1  erdos_renyi(n::Integer, p::Real)
```
*Source: [1](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/tree/ee65811af7056c6ae43447a6c983a6d9708bf0cf/src/randgraphs.jl#L44)*.

Creates an [Erdős–Rényi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős–Rényi_model) random graph with `n` vertices. Edges are added between pairs of vertices with probability `p`. Undirected graphs are created by default; use `is_directed=true` to override.

Note also that Erdős–Rényi graphs may be generated quickly using the `Graph(nv, ne)` constructor, which randomly includes `ne` edges from the set of vertices.

### watts_strogatz
```
1  watts_strogatz(n::Integer, k::Integer, β::Real)
```
*Source: [1](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/tree/ee65811af7056c6ae43447a6c983a6d9708bf0cf/src/randgraphs.jl#L68)*.

Creates a [Watts-Strogatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model) small model random graph with `n` vertices, each with degree `k`. Edges are randomized per the model based on probability `β`. Undirected graphs are created by default; use `is_directed=true` to override.

### random_regular_graph
```
1  random_regular_graph(n::Int64, k::Int64)
2  random_regular_graph(n::Int64, k::Int64, seed::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/tree/ee65811af7056c6ae43447a6c983a6d9708bf0cf/src/randgraphs.jl#L153) [2](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/tree/ee65811af7056c6ae43447a6c983a6d9708bf0cf/src/randgraphs.jl#L153)*.

Creates a random undirected [regular graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_graph) with `n` vertices, each with degree `k`.

For undirected graphs, allocates an array of `nk` `Int`s, and takes approximately $nk^2$ time. For $k > n/2$, generates a graph of degree `n-k-1` and returns its complement.

### random_regular_digraph
```
1  random_regular_digraph(n::Int64, k::Int64)
2  random_regular_digraph(n::Int64, k::Int64, dir::Symbol)
3  random_regular_digraph(n::Int64, k::Int64, dir::Symbol, seed::Int64)
```

Creates a random directed [regular graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_graph) with `n` vertices, each with degree `k`. The degree (in or out) can be specified using `dir=:in` or `dir=:out`. The default is `dir=:out`.

For directed graphs, allocates an $n \times n$ sparse matrix of boolean as an adjacency matrix and uses that to generate the directed graph.



## Static Graphs
*LightGraphs.jl* also implements a collection of classic graph generators:

### CompleteGraph
