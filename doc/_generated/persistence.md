## Writing a Graph
Graphs may be written to I/O streams and files using the `write` function:

### write
```
1  write(io::IO, graphname::AbstractString, g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
2  write(io::IO, g::LightGraphs.Graph)
3  write(io::IO, g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
4  write(g::LightGraphs.Graph)
5  write(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
6  write{S<:AbstractString,G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(graphs::Dict{S<:AbstractString,G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}, fn::AbstractString)
7  write(g::LightGraphs.Graph, fn::AbstractString)
8  write(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph, fn::AbstractString)
9  write(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, gname::AbstractString, fn::AbstractString)
```

```rst
::
           write(stream, x)

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given stream.
```

Writes a graph `g` with name `graphname` in a proprietary format to the IO stream designated by `io`.

Returns 1 (number of graphs written).

Writes a dictionary of (name=>graph) to a file `fn`, with default `GZip` compression.

Returns number of graphs written.



## Reading a Graph From a File
Graphs stored using the `write` functions above may be loaded using `readgraph`:

### readgraph
```
1  readgraph(fn::AbstractString)
2  readgraph(fn::AbstractString, gname::AbstractString)
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass)*
Returns a dictionary of (name=>graph) loaded from file `fn`.

### readgraphml
```
1  readgraphml(filename::AbstractString)
2  readgraphml(filename::AbstractString, gname::AbstractString)
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass)*
Returns a dictionary (name=>graph) from file `fn` stored in [GraphML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) format. Can optionally restrict to a single graph by specifying a name in gname.

### readgml
```
1  readgml(filename::AbstractString)
2  readgml(filename::AbstractString, gname::AbstractString)
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass)*
Returns a dictionary (name=>graph) from file `fn` stored in [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) format. Can optionally restrict to a single graph by specifying a name in gname.



## Examples
```julia
julia> write(STDOUT, g)
julia> write(g, "mygraph.jgz")
julia> g = readgraph("mygraph.jgz")
julia> g = readgraphml("mygraph.xml")
julia> g = readgml("mygraph.gml")
```
