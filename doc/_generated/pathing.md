*LightGraphs.jl* provides several traversal and shortest-path algorithms, along with
various utility functions. Where appropriate, edge distances may be passed in as a
matrix of real number values. The matrix should be indexed by `[src, dst]` (see [Getting Started](gettingstarted.html) for more information).

## Graph Traversal

*Graph traversal* refers to a process that traverses vertices of a graph following certain order (starting from user-input sources). This package implements three traversal schemes:
* `BreadthFirst`,
* `DepthFirst`, and
* `MaximumAdjacency`.

### bfs_tree
```
1  bfs_tree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, s::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/tree/ee65811af7056c6ae43447a6c983a6d9708bf0cf/src/traversals/bfs.jl#L167)*.

Provides a breadth-first traversal of the graph `g` starting with source vertex `s`, and returns a directed acyclic graph of vertices in the order they were discovered.

### dfs_tree
```
1  dfs_tree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, s::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/tree/ee65811af7056c6ae43447a6c983a6d9708bf0cf/src/traversals/dfs.jl#L196)*.

Provides a depth-first traversal of the graph `g` starting with source vertex `s`, and returns a directed acyclic graph of vertices in the order they were discovered.



## Connectivity / Bipartiteness
`Graph connectivity` functions are defined on both undirected and directed graphs:

Returns the condensation graph associated with `g`. The condensation `h` of a graph `g` is the directed graph where every node in `h` represents a strongly connected component in `g`, and the presence of an edge between between nodes in `h` indicates that there is at least one edge between the associated strongly connected components in `g`. The node numbering in `h` corresponds to the ordering of the components output from `strongly_connected_components`.

`v` and ends up at `v`.

Stoer's simple minimum cut gets the minimum cut of an undirected graph.

### mincut

Returns a tuple `(parity, bestcut)`, where `parity` is a vector of boolean values that determines the partition in `g` and `bestcut` is the weight of the cut that makes this partition. An optional `distmx` matrix may be specified; if omitted, edge distances are assumed to be 1.

Returns the vertices in `g` traversed by maximum adjacency search. An optional `distmx` matrix may be specified; if omitted, edge distances are assumed to be 1. If `log` (default `false`) is `true`, visitor events will be printed to `io`, which defaults to `STDOUT`; otherwise, no event information will be displayed.



## Shortest-Path Algorithms

General properties of shortest path algorithms:

* The distance from a vertex to itself is always `0`.
* The distance between two vertices with no connecting edge is always `Inf`.

Uses the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman–Ford_algorithm) to compute shortest paths between a source vertex `s` or a set of source vertices `ss`. Returns a `BellmanFordState` with relevant traversal information (see below).

Given a path state `state` of type `AbstractPathState` (see below), returns a vector (indexed by vertex) of the paths between the source vertex used to compute the path state and a destination vertex `v`, a set of destination vertices `vs`, or the entire graph. For multiple destination vertices, each path is represented by a vector of vertices on the path between the source and the destination. Nonexistent paths will be indicated by an empty vector. For single destinations, the path is represented by a single vector of vertices, and will be length 0 if the path does not exist.

For Floyd-Warshall path states, please note that the output is a bit different, since this algorithm calculates all shortest paths for all pairs of vertices: `enumerate_paths(state)` will return a vector (indexed by source vertex) of vectors (indexed by destination vertex) of paths. `enumerate_paths(state, v)` will return a vector (indexed by destination vertex) of paths from source `v` to all other vertices. In addition, `enumerate_paths(state, v, d)` will return a vector representing the path from vertex `v` to vertex `d`.



For Floyd-Warshall path states, please note that the output is a bit different,
since this algorithm calculates all shortest paths for all pairs of vertices: `enumerate_paths(state)` will return a vector (indexed by source vertex) of
vectors (indexed by destination vertex) of paths. `enumerate_paths(state, v)`
will return a vector (indexed by destination vertex) of paths from source `v`

a vector representing the path from vertex `v` to vertex `d`.

## Path States
The `floyd_warshall_shortest_paths`, `bellman_ford_shortest_paths`,
`dijkstra_shortest_paths`, and `dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance` functions
return a state that contains various information about the graph learned during
traversal. The three state types have the following common information,
accessible via the type:

`.dists`
Holds a vector of distances computed, indexed by source vertex.

`.parents`
Holds a vector of parents of each source vertex. The parent of a source vertex
is always `0`.

In addition, the `dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance` function stores the
following information:

`.predecessors`
Holds a vector, indexed by vertex, of all the predecessors discovered during
shortest-path calculations. This keeps track of all parents when there are
multiple shortest paths available from the source.

`.pathcounts`
Holds a vector, indexed by vertex, of the path counts discovered during
traversal. This equals the length of each subvector in the `.predecessors`
output above.
