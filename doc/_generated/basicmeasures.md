The following basic measures have been implemented for `Graph` and `DiGraph`
types:

## Vertices and Edges

### vertices
```
1  vertices(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})

```
1  is_directed(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
2  is_directed(g::LightGraphs.Graph)
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass)*
Returns `true` if `g` is a `DiGraph`.

### nv
```
1  nv(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*

### ne
```
1  ne(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*

### has_edge
```
1  has_edge(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, src::Int64, dst::Int64)
2  has_edge(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph, e::Pair{Int64,Int64})
3  has_edge(g::LightGraphs.Graph, e::Pair{Int64,Int64})
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass) [3](#pass)*
Return true if the graph `g` has an edge from `src` to `dst`.

### has_vertex
```
1  has_vertex(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return true if `v` is a vertex of `g`.

### in_edges

```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return an Array of the edges in `g` that arrive at vertex `v`.

### out_edges
```
1  out_edges(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return an Array of the edges in `g` that emanate from vertex `v`.

### src
```
1  src(e::Pair{Int64,Int64})
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return source of an edge.

### dst
```
1  dst(e::Pair{Int64,Int64})
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return destination of an edge.

### reverse
```
1  reverse(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
```rst
::
           reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )

Return a copy of ``v`` reversed from start to stop.
```

(`DiGraph` only) Produces a graph where all edges are reversed from the original.



## Neighbors and Degree

### degree
```
1  degree(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph, v::Int64)
2  degree(g::LightGraphs.Graph, v::Int64)
3  degree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
4  degree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::AbstractArray{Int64,1})
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass) [3](#pass) [4](#pass)*
Return the number of edges (both ingoing and outgoing) from the vertex `v`.

### indegree
```
1  indegree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
2  indegree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::Int64)
3  indegree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::AbstractArray{Int64,1})
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass) [3](#pass)*
Return the number of edges which start at vertex `v`.

### outdegree
```
1  outdegree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
2  outdegree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::Int64)
3  outdegree(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::AbstractArray{Int64,1})
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass) [3](#pass)*
Return the number of edges which end at vertex `v`.

### Δ
```
1  Δ(g)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return the maximum `degree` of vertices in `g`.

### δ
```
1  δ(g)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return the minimum `degree` of vertices in `g`.

### Δout
```
1  Δout(g)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return the maxium `outdegree` of vertices in `g`.

### δout
```
1  δout(g)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return the minimum `outdegree` of vertices in `g`.

### δin
```
1  δin(g)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return the maximum `indegree` of vertices in `g`.

### Δin
```
1  Δin(g)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Return the minimum `indegree` of vertices in `g`.

### degree_histogram
```
1  degree_histogram(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Produces a histogram of degree values across all vertices for the graph `g`. The number of histogram buckets is based on the number of vertices in `g`.

### density
```
1  density(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
2  density(g::LightGraphs.Graph)
```
*Source: [1](#pass) [2](#pass)*
Density is defined as the ratio of the number of actual edges to the number of possible edges. This is $|v| |v-1|$ for directed graphs and $(|v| |v-1|) / 2$ for undirected graphs.

### neighbors
```
1  neighbors(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Returns a list of all neighbors of vertex `v` in `g`.

For DiGraphs, this is equivalent to `out_neighbors(g, v)`.

### in_neighbors
```
1  in_neighbors(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, v::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Returns a list of all neighbors connected to vertex `v` by an incoming edge.

### all_neighbors
```
1  all_neighbors(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph, v::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Returns all the vertices which share an edge with `v`.

### common_neighbors
```
1  common_neighbors(g::Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, u::Int64, v::Int64)
```
*Source: [1](#pass)*
Returns the neighbors common to vertices `u` and `v` in `g`.
